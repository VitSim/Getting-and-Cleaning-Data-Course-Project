# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
this is my project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course
You should downlaod and unzip the data file in your course directory

The R script called run_analysis.R can do:
1. Load both the traing and the test datasets and merge them in one file
2. Load the feature info
3. Select only the columns with mean or standard deviation data
4. Load the activity info
5. Converts both activity and subject into factors
6. Group a tidy dataset for each subject and activity and calculate the average (mean) for all the other columns.
7. Export this tidy dataset in the file tidy.txt
